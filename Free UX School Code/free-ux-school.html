            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>I designed and developed the site you're on right now, FreeUXSchool.org, as a passion project. I've always wanted to share what I know about UX, plus I enjoy coding my own websites. I also did all of the graphics and copywriting.</h2>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Purpose</h2>
            <h2>UX Bootcamps and colleges are charging people crazy amounts of money to learn UX. At the time of creating this, I was a Senior UX Architect at Dow Jones where I worked with brands like Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.com -- I didn't formally take any UX course to get to this point. I just learned on YouTube...for free! So I thought, <b>I might as well make a free "bootcamp" that anyone can do without any financial barriers!</b>

            <h2>I know that not everyone learns the same, so I wanted to present a variety of types of content. I wanted to think about this from a sensory standpoint. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Watching: Some people learn from watching videos</li>
                    <li>Listening: Some people learn from listening to podcasts or audiobooks</li>
                    <li>Reading: Some people learn from reading texts</li>
                    <li>Doing: Some people learn from doing interactive activities like courses with guided assignments.  </li>
                </ul>
                I wanted to create all of these learning formats...without paying $50/month for a online teaching platform (sorry Teachable!) and coding it from scratch. So...that's how we got here.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <h2>I was pretty light on detailed research for this one since it was a pure passion project, but I did do a candid competitive analysis for the different types of content. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spotify is my main listening avenue, I wanted to create a great listening experience for everyone, so I used their child company <a class="link" href="https://anchor.fm">Anchor</a> to create a podcast.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Watching
                        <ul>
                            <li>Everybody is familiar with YouTube...so I tried to mimic their video experience. But I hate the look of the embedded YouTube videos so I used Vimeo. (Yay, no ads! :) )</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Reading
                        <ul>
                            <li>We've all read articles where there are a bunch of ads wedged in the text and random videos playing on the screen to try to get you to click...I didn't want to do that to you. I made sure to create a barebones article experience for minimal distractions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Courses
                        <ul>
                            <li>I initually purchased a membership with Thinkific...an online teaching platform so I could create this site. However...it was lacking customization and the course player for the videos just looked a little...ugly tbh. I created my own with HTML / CSS and Javascript.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

            <p style="max-width: 500px;"> I call this component a 'Content Card'. I use it all over this site! It is perfect for grouping a particular type of content while giving space for a header, image, description and call-to-action. They're clean, modern and versatile!</p>
