            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <h2>I led UX Strategy and Architecture for a homepage redesign for MarketWatch's new product offering, MarketWatch Picks. MarketWatch Picks provides readers with expert opinions to help them make wise financial decisions for retirement, investing and everyday purchases.</h2>

            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Purpose</h2>
            <h2>MarketWatch Picks had a silent launch on the MarketWatch website to see if users would actually enjoy their content. They quickly took off due to organic SEO traffic and challenged competitors such as CNBC, CNN and Forbes in this niche financial news space. MarketWatch Picks needed to redesign their homepage to help them: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Establish their brand</li>
                    <li>Reduce bounce rate</li>
                    <li>Increase article click through rate</li>
                </ol> 
            </h2>

            <br> 
            <p style="max-width: 500px;">This is the old MW Picks experience...it lacked a clear structure, induced cognitive load with large, invasive ads and failed to establish MW Picks as a brand.  </p>

            <h2> MarketWatch (MW) easily surpasses 100 million page views each month, and loyal users were beginning to become aware of the useful content MW Picks was offering. With millions of potential visitors coming to this site, the importance of starting off on the right foot was truly monumental. This could truly make or break MW Picks and their brand.

    <ul>
        <li>Identity Crisis
            <ul>
                <li> Deciding how to establish MW Picks as its' own brand without deviating too much from the parent brand, MarketWatch.</li>

        <li>Navigation
            <ul>
                <li> MW Picks and MarketWatch had different navigation pathways, and we needed to position them strategically to avoid causing confusion.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Horizontal Real Estate
            <ul>
