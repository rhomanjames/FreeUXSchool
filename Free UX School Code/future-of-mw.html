            <h2>I was hired a Senior UX Architect as Dow Jones, which is a news company that is comprised of various brands. One of those brands is a financial news site named MarketWatch. 
                My main priority at Dow Jones was to lead the UX Strategy and Architecture for the MarketWatch digital experience. This project was the first step of understanding
                the current state of the MarketWatch site from a UX perspective, which helped me identify various areas of improvement.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <h2>Our main goal of this project was not to produce a definitive visual design that would be adopted, but rather to identify the areas of improvement before moving to the visual design 
                phase. For this reason conducting thorough research and research analysis was essential to elucidating those opportunities. Our main research methods were: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
                    <li>Heuristic Analysis</li>

            <h2>I looked at some of MarketWatch's primary competitors to get a better idea of how MarketWatch stacked up against them. After looking at CNN Money, Financial Times, Seeking Alpha and Yahoo Finance, we found various areas of improvement.

            <h2>We saw a fair amout of traffic going to our articles, which could come from third party affiliates or organic searches, but when users were on our site, over 90% of them navigated to the three following areas:
                <ul>
                    <li>Watchlist</li>

                This led us to believe that even though MarketWatch is branded as a financial news site, user may actually be going to the site primarily for their tools and research information on the markets.

            <h1>Outcomes and Next Steps</h1>
            <h2>By stepping back to analyze the current state of MarketWatch, we identified various areas of improvement for the future. The primary areas are: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Strategy
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                MarketWatch needs to establish clear brand direction so that we can begin to build the site strategy in singular direction. </li>
                               <li> <b>Is MarketWatch a financial news site that offers tools, or a financial tools site that offers news? The answer to this questions determines the trajectory of the site.</b>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <br>

                        Personalization
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If we have over a million daily users, not everyone wants to see the same thing. We currently present the same information in the same formate to everyone.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>We need to present personalized content that is directly relevant to our users preferences. We need to adapt to our user's individual needs.</b>
                                </li>
                            </li>

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Accessibility
                        <ul>
                            <li>The way we present our content matters. When we present too much information at once with no clear stucture, user's can easily become overwhelmed.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Minimal and aesthetic designs don't just look pretty, they increase accessibility for all users and make a more marketable and usable product!</b>
                                </li>
                            </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                The next step in this process is aligning the product roadmap with these architectural and design needs to ensure clean and efficient implementation.
