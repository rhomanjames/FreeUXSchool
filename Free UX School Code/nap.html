With over $1 billion in annual revenue from their catalog of brands, their digital presence needed an upgrade to be on par with their prestige in the industry.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Purpose</h2>
            <h2> The plastics industry isn't very progressive digitally. Most people just do sales over the phone or in person at trade shows, so their digital presence historically hasn't determined their success. North American Plastics (NAP) wanted to improve their digital presence 
                by making over their dated, clunky old website to a modern, progressive website that could bolster their digital identity.

The goal was to create a landing page for the brand that would showcase their capabilities, child brands and serve as a recruitment tool. The site was built in Wordpress, and I needed to rebuild the site in Wordpress to facilitate future editing.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Heuristic Analysis </h2>
            <h2>We began this redesign project with a heuristic analysis of the site that was live at that time. There were many areas of improvement, but after conducting the analysis using <a class="link">Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design</a>, I identified three main areas of growth: 
    <ul>
        <li>Consistency and Standards
            <ul>
                <li> The NAP site seemed to be thrown together with no clear strategy for why certain design decisions were made. The result of an unclear strategy was widespread inconsistencies and an absence of standards.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Match between system and real world
            <ul>
                <li> The previous site was geared toward experts in the industry who had very specific knowledge of the business. It did not cater to college-aged job seekers or first time buyers, both of which were target personas for this website. <b> In the new site we needed to ensure we use easy to understand terms and images that make sense to a wide audience.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Aesthetic and minimal design
            <ul>
                <li>The look of the site was dated and simply unprofessional. <b>The quality of the site was not commensurate with a $1B (billion) industry leader,</b> primarily due to a cluttered layout and out-of-date design decisions. </li>

            <h2>I analyzed some of NAP's top competitors, chiefly <a class="link" href="https://www.grimco.com">Grimco</a> to see what they offered that we didnt. We extracted three key points from this analysis: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Imagery Matters
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typically in the plastics industry, people just show a bunch of stock images of plastic. The CEO told me he didnt want to be portrayed as just another plastics brand.</li>
                            <li><b>In order to stand out, we needed to have people-centered imagery, not product-centered imagery.</b></li>

                            <li>The competitors with the most online traction typically had simpler layouts and highly usable sites. <b>In order to succeed, we had to embrace simplicity.</b></li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The plastics industry is about 20 years behind other industries in terms of digital advancement. <b>To ensure we stay ahead of the curve, we had to avoid copying our competitors. We needed to truly set the digital standard as the industry leader.</b></li>

                <ul>
                   <li>We embraced simplicity and presented a very simple '50/50' section template, where half of the section was text (header + text + CTA) and other half was a clear image, ideally of a person. </li>
                    <li>We ensured that the site was easy to scan, by a familiar layout. This way, users could tap into their existing schema to quickly read through the contents. </li>
                    <li>We approached this from a "templatized" format to ensure that we could quickly spin up new pages if necessary. Without dedicated developer support, ongoing maintenance and simplified editing was a top consideration. </li>

                        <ul>

                                NAP's primary brand color is green...but green can QUICKLY become overwhelming on a site. We decided to use it as an accent to white instead to give the site a pop while retaining its' brand identity.
