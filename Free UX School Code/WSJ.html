            <h2>I served as the UX Architecture lead on team of three to explore a new concept for redesigning the Wall Street Journal.</h2>

            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Purpose</h2>
            <h2>I had been working at Dow Jones for a few months before starting this project. I was primarily focused with one of Dow Jones' subsidiaries, MarketWatch.com, where I lead the UX strategy and architecture.
                <br> <br>The VP of UX architecture informed me that I would be a part of an initiative to explore redesign concept for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the most popular of the Dow Jones brands.
                WSJ has had a similar look for decades, so proposing an entire structural and design makeover that could affect the future of the brand was truly a monumental task, but also an honor. <br> <br>To kickstart the process, the design executives brought together
                designers and architects from across the brand to visually hypothesize the future of the Wall Street Journal.</h2>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Scope</h2>
            <h2>WSJ reaches over 42 million digital readers per month, which positions them as one of the top digital news sources in the world. Though it would be admirable for a team of three to single-handedly redesign this experience, we all know this would be imposisble. 
                <br> <br> For the scope of this project, we just focused on redesigning the home page experience to explore the possibilities of what WSJ could evolve into. WSJ has been around for over 120 years, with their digital age nearing 30. With such 
                prestige and history at stake, the importance of going in the correct design direction cannot be understated.

            <h2>This design exploration was made up of 4 separate teams exploring different design directions. Each team had 3-4 members and was given some guiding principles to follow. 
                My team of three was tasked to focus on navigation. The drivers of our discovery were: 
                <ul>
                    <li>User's control over navigation and content</li>
                    <li>Prioritize timely topics as navigational elements</li>
                    <li>Enable easy video/audio media consumption</li>

                    <li>Heuristic Analysis</li>

                the most popular news media companies and how they utilize navigation to encourage exploration and establish clear wayfinding coupled with intentional personalization. 
            Two competitors that I can disclose are Reddit and YouTube, which are very popular for their ability to encourage exploration through their site, while also giving the users
        what they initially came for. Overall, we wanted to include the following aspects to stay abreast with current trends and user needs:
    <ul>
        <li>Exceptional search experiences</li>
        <li>Sidebar navigation</li>
        <li>Hyper-personalized content presented in high-priority locations</li>

            <h2>WSJ is a behemoth in the digital media space, but its' website definitely has various areas that can be improved. In a quick heuristic analysis using <a class="link">Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design</a> I disovered
                three primary areas of improvement. 
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It's very difficult to utilize the navigation bar due to a lack of clear and relevant pathways.</li>
