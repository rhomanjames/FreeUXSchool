       <h2 class="sub-heading">Defining research objectives and questions</h2>
       
       Accessibility is the practice of designing products and services that are usable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. This includes individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments, as well as those with temporary or situational disabilities.
<br> <br> 
In the field of UX architecture, accessibility is essential because it ensures that all users can effectively use and benefit from the product or service. This is important not only for ethical and legal reasons, but also because designing for accessibility can improve the user experience for everyone. Accessibility considerations can help to create more intuitive and efficient interfaces, and can make products more usable in a wider range of contexts and situations.
<br> <br> 
Overall, accessibility is a crucial aspect of UX architecture, and it is important to consider the needs of all users in the design process. This may involve implementing features such as high contrast modes, text-to-speech functionality, and keyboard accessibility, among others.

<h2 class="sub-heading">Identifying Target Participants </h2>

The <a class="link" href="https://w3.org">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> provide a set of guidelines for designing products and services that are accessible to users with disabilities. Here are five things to consider when designing for users with disabilities according to WCAG:
<br> <br> 
<b>Perceivable</b><br>  Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive, whether through sight, hearing, or touch.
<br> <br> 
<b>Operable</b><br>  User interface components and navigation must be operable through a variety of methods, including keyboard input, touch, and voice commands.
<br> <br> 
<b>Understandable</b><br>  Information and the operation of user interface components must be understandable by the user, with clear and simple language and instructions.
<br> <br> 
<b>Robust </b><br> The product or service must be robust enough to work with a wide range of assistive technologies and user interfaces.
<br> <br> 
<b>Compatibility</b><br>  The product or service must be compatible with a wide range of devices and web browsers, including assistive technologies such as screen readers.
       
        <br>
        <br> <h2 class="sub-heading">Compliance with accessibility guidelines (e.g. WCAG)</h2>
        Adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is important for several reasons. First and foremost, it helps to ensure that products and services are accessible to users with disabilities, which is important for ethical and legal reasons. By following the guidelines, you can help to create products and services that are usable by a wider range of people, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
<br> <br> 
In addition to the ethical and legal considerations, adhering to WCAG guidelines can also have practical benefits for businesses and organizations. By designing for accessibility, you can improve the user experience for everyone, not just users with disabilities. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, as well as reduced support costs and increased revenue.
<br> <br> 
Overall, adhering to WCAG guidelines is an important aspect of UX design, and it is essential to consider the needs of all users in the design process. By following the guidelines, you can create products and services that are usable, enjoyable, and accessible to everyone.
